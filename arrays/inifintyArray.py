# Suppose you have a sorted array of infinite numbers, how would you search an element in the array?
# Source: Amazon Interview Experience. 
# Since array is sorted, the first thing clicks into mind is binary search, but the problem here is that we donâ€™t know size of array. 
# If the array is infinite, that means we donâ€™t have proper bounds to apply binary search. 
# So in order to find position of key, first we find bounds and then apply binary search algorithm.

# We start with a size of two then increse the bound
# 2 , 4 ,8
